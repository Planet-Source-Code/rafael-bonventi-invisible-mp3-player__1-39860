hey all this is a sweet little player that sits on your systray and it plays *.jpg files that are actually *.mp3 files :-)

Reason why:

i have a really harsh boss and he does not like us to listem mp3 while we code, so i made this quick solution

How to:
	step1  -  copy all of your *.mp3 files to the JPG folder 
	setp2  -  Run mp.exe then push the *.mp3 to *.jpg button this should rename all of your mp3 files
		  to blah.jpg
	setp3  -  Now you can listem *.mp3 files that look like *.jpg files, and if the admin comes at your machine
		  and searches for *.mp3 files guess what he aint going to find anything :-)
	setp4  -  If you right lick the icon on systray it will close the player imediatelly.

I hope you all can learn from this code and i hope to get some votes for this as well 
all developers out there have a nice day and may God Bless us all 

peace out every one
